What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Realization: I was getting multiple errors that didn't make sense to me (like indentation when I knew it was right), it turns out the problem was that I didn't declare the attributes. Once I did that everything worked.
I had to do "from Computer import Computer" to get the class to work, I tried "import Computer" first, but then it took in a module.
I realized I forgot to include "self" in methods
I had to use "self.inventory[itemID].description" instead of "self.inventory[itemID]", which just lead to the Computer location.

Definitely break the assignment up into parts instead of trying to figure out how to do it all at once; then it feels overwhelming.
